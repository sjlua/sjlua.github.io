# Personal website
This website was originally created back in 2024, to learn some of the basics behind HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has now been updated, with a whole new fresh coat of paint, and a new project.

This is now an archive of the old website, which is still available at [sjlua.github.io](https://sjlua.github.io/), but the new redesigned website is now available at [sjlua.dev](https://sjlua.dev/).
